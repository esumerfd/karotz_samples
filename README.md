karotz_samples
==============

Just got a Karotz for my birthday and these are the first sample apps to explore the features.

You will have to do a little editing to make this work with your karotz.

{code}
Edit app_*/main.js
set the karotz_ip to the IP of you karotz.
{code}

Then just run the app.

{code}
bin/run.sh app_*
{code}
